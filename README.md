# Histori Node Service

Welcome to the **Histori Node Service** repository. This project provides the core functionality for handling blockchain data requests. It includes utilities for building, deploying, and running the service in development and production environments.
---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 16 or higher
- **npm**: Installed with Node.js
- Compatible browser for viewing the documentation.

---

## üì¶ Project Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:
1.	Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
2. Ensure your environment variables are properly configured in a .env file or set in your shell.


## üìñ Configuring `networks.json`

The `networks.json` file is where you configure network-specific details for accessing blockchain data through the Histori RPC Router. This includes RPC URLs and network IDs. You can fill this configuration with custom RPC URLs or use **Histori‚Äôs multi-RPC service** for seamless integration.

### üìù How to Fill `networks.json`

1. **Understand the Fields**:
   - **`networkId`**: A unique identifier for the network (e.g., `eth-mainnet`).
   - **`rpc`**: List of RPC URLs for the network.

2. **Option 1: Using Custom RPC URLs**:
   - Replace the `<YOUR_HISTORI_PROJECT_ID_HERE>` placeholder in the `rpc.url` with your preferred RPC URL.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
         "url": "https://custom-node.example.com/eth-mainnet"
     }
     ```

3. **Option 2: Using Histori Multi-RPC Service**:
   - Histori provides a multi-RPC service with optimized performance and reliability. Follow these steps to obtain your `projectId`:
