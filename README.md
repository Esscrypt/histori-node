# Histori Node Service

Welcome to the **Histori RPC Router** repository.

The Histori RPC Router is a robust service designed to provide access to blockchain data across multiple networks. With features like unified multi-network support, secure transaction submission via Flashbots integration, fallback RPC calls on failure and verification of RPC calls from multiple providers, it simplifies the development of decentralized applications while ensuring data integrity and security. The service includes advanced capabilities such as parallel requests for consistency verification, automatic fallback mechanisms for high availability, and random provider selection for load balancing and rate limit safety, making it ideal for high-traffic applications like DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces. Whether you need reliable access to historical blockchain states or protection against MEV attacks, Histori RPC Router delivers performance, reliability, and peace of mind.

## üì¶ Project Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:
1.	Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
2. Ensure your environment variables are properly configured in a .env file or set in your shell.


## üìñ Configuring `networks.json`

The `networks.json` file is where you configure network-specific details for accessing blockchain data through the Histori RPC Router. This includes RPC URLs and network IDs. You can fill this configuration with custom RPC URLs or use **Histori‚Äôs multi-RPC service** for seamless integration.

### üìù How to Fill `networks.json`

1. **Understand the Fields**:
   - **`networkId`**: A unique identifier for the network (e.g., `eth-mainnet`).
   - **`rpc`**: List of RPC URLs for the network.

2. **Option 1: Using Custom RPC URLs**:
   - Replace the `<YOUR_HISTORI_PROJECT_ID_HERE>` placeholder in the `rpc.url` with your preferred RPC URL.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
         "url": "https://custom-node.example.com/eth-mainnet"
     }
     ```

3. **Option 2: Using Histori Multi-RPC Service**:
   - Histori provides a multi-RPC service with optimized performance and reliability. Follow these steps to obtain your `projectId`:
